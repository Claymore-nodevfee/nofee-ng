nofee-ng for ETH: The Next Generation NoDevFee Mining Software for Ethereum
===

`nofee_eth` is an implementation of `nofee-ng` for ETH.

## Notes ##

1. `nofee_eth` is tested with PhoenixMiner. If it can't work with your miner software, leave me an issue.
2. The refunded mining pool and worker's name varies for different miners:
 + For PhoenixMiner, the worker's name is *eth1.0*. The mining pool could be your main mining pool, [Nanopool](https://eth.nanopool.org), or [ETHPOOL](https://ethpool.org/)
