Diskless Mining Solution for Large Scale Farms
===

We provide a commercial Diskless Mining Solution for our clients, especially large scale farms. We will deploy diskless mining operation system via a central server. All the miners **DO NOT** need to install an HDD, SSD or USB drive, since their OS including the mining software are provisioned via the central server.

Benifits of such a solution:

+ Save the cost of HDD, SSD or USB drive. And additionally the power consumption of the drive.
+ Easy for maintenance. Software between all miners are strictly the same. There is no need to install their OS separately.
+ Central monitor service for all the miners. When a miner becomes offline in the pool, it will be detected and brought up automatically to reduce down time.
+ A unified monitor GUI (Graphics User Interface) to monitor the working status of all your miners.
+ In case of unstable fluctuation of price for the mining cryptocurrency, you can swith to mine another coin more quickly.
+ Low capability requirement for the field maintenance worker. He just need to maintain the hardware.
+ Linux Diskless Mining Solution has lower requirement: 2G RAM for miners; 4G RAM and 10G SSD for server; faster booting speed and more stable than Windows solutions
+ Linux Diskless Mining Solution doesn't need a SAN network. 1 Gbps ethernet is enough. All the miners share the same operation system image. In contrast, Windows diskless solution require separate iSCSI configuration for each miner.
+ Deployment of [nofee-ng](https://github.com/nofee-ng/) with no extra charge. `nofee-ng` can refund DevFee from the mining software to your own wallet which can be different from the main mining wallet.

大规模矿场无盘挖矿解决方案
===

我们为客户（特别是大规模的矿场）提供商业化的无盘挖矿解决方案。该方案将通过中央服务器为矿机提供无盘挖矿的操作系统。所有的矿机**无需**安装硬盘（HDD、SSD）或U盘，因为包括挖矿软件在内的整个操作系统均通过中央服务器进行下发。

无盘挖矿的优点：

+ 节省硬盘价格及硬盘功耗产生的电费
+ 易于维护，所有矿机的系统保持高度一致，无需单独安装矿机操作系统
+ 可自动监控矿池中矿机状态，对因软件问题引起的矿机掉线可自动重启，重新挖矿，减少停机时间
+ 具有统一的图形监控界面可监控各个矿机的实时挖矿情况
+ 对于币值波动，可快速切换挖矿币种
+ 对现场维护人员要求低，只需负责更换硬件（如有损坏）即可
+ Linux无盘方案对系统的要求低度：矿机内存2G；服务器内存4G，硬盘10G即可；矿机启动速度远比Windows快，系统更稳定
+ Linux无盘方案无需专用的SAN网络，千兆以太网即可，且所有矿机共享同一个系统镜像，无需像Windows无盘方案一样单独为每台矿机配iSCSI
+ 可以免费部署 [nofee-ng](https://github.com/nofee-ng/) 。`nofee-ng`可以将挖矿软件所劫持的算力（DevFee）返还到你的钱包中，该钱包可以不同于挖矿的主钱包。
